hundred-shades-of-gray

Status: in early development

It is not "theme in e-ink style". It is

Pure grayscale monochrome emacs theme, optimized for real e-ink display.

We should use all possible e-ink display capabilities here!

All colors are defined in form "gray0" (black) .. "gray100" (white)

My setup:
* android tablet with monochrome e-ink display, supporting near 16 grayscale colors
* emacs in terminal mode
* termux as terminal emulator
* variable TERM=xterm-24bit
* terminal supports bold text (please ensure that your terminal really can do this) 

Other "monochrome" themes you can check:
* package almost-mono-themes, theme almost-mono-white
* package brutalist-theme, theme brutalist
* package tao-theme, theme tao-yang
* package monotropic-theme, theme monotropic
* package eink-theme, theme eink
* package eziam-themes, theme eziam-light
